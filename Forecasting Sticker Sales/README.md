# [Forecasting Sticker Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e1)

For this challenge, you will be predicting multiple years worth of sales for various Kaggle-branded stickers from different fictitious stores in different (real!) countries. This dataset is completely synthetic, but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc.
